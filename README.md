#### You can always count on me when... 

I can create beautiful features for websites because I'm using Figma. You can design mobile apps and websites also you can make prototypes in Figma. Additional you can copy a bunch of code of your design...

##### A funny story 
Maybe not really funny but good anekdote.
When i did interrail with my friends we met with a guy in Italy. When we were going to Capri we were talking each other and one guy heard us on a ferry. He asked us which language are we speaking and then we became friend with him. We encountered him in Rome and we just learned that he was a tour guide. So he explained all the details about historical places it was amazing. 

###### TL;DR 

When i did interrail with my friends we met a guy in Capri and he became our friend and guide.
